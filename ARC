Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)
Model the lifetime of objects and their relationships.

1. What is ARC?
Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to track and manage your app’s memory usage. 

Reference counting applies only to the classes. 
Structures and enumerations are value types, not reference types, and aren’t stored and passed by reference.
