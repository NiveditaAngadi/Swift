Protocol 
Define requirements that confirming types must implement. 

1. What is protocol?
A protocol defines a blue print of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. 
A protocol can be adopted by a class, structure or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. 
Any type that satisfies the requirments of a protcol is said to conform to the protcol. 

2. Can protcol be extended?
Yes. You can extend a protcol to implement some of these requirements or to implement additional functionality that confirming types can take advantage of.
