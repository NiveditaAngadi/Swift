Set the initial values for a type's stored properties and perform one-time setup. 

1. What is initialization?
Initialization is the process of preparing class, structure, enumeration for use. This process involves setting an initial value for each stored property on that instance and performing
any other setup or initailzation that required before the new instance is ready for use. 

2. Does swift initializer returns a value?
No

3. What is deinitializer?
Method which performs any custom cleanup just before an instance of that class is deallocated. 

4. Is it compulasary to set an intial value to stored property by the time an instance of that class or structure is created?
Yes. Stored property can not be left indeterminate state. 

5. What are the ways for setting value to the stored property?
1. You can set value to the stored property within an initializer. 
2. By assigning a default property value as part of the property's definition. 

6. Property of optional type are initialized to what value?
Property of optional type are automatically initialized to nil. 

7. Can you modify the value of constant property, once its value is assigned?
No. 

8. What is default initializer?
Swift provides a default initializer for any structure or class that provides default values for all of its properties. The default initializer simply creates a new instance with all of 
its properties set to their default values.

9. What is memberwise initializer for structure types?
Structure types automatically receive a memberwise initializer if they don’t define any of their own custom initializers. 
The memberwise initializer is a shorthand way to initialize the member properties of new structure instances.
Initial values for the properties of the new instance can be passed to the memberwise initializer by name.

10. What is initializer delegation?
Initializers can call other initializers to perform part of an instance's initialization. This process known as initialiser delegation. 
This avoids duplicating code across multiple initializers. 

11. What is value type initializer delegation?
In value type initializer delgation is relatively simple. Since, it won't support the inheritance, they can only delegate another initializer that they provide themselves. 
For value types, you use self.init to refer to other initializers from the same value type when writing your own custom initializers. 
You can call self.init only from within an initializer.

12. Can we call memberwise initializer, if define the custom initializer?
Note that if you define a custom initializer for a value type, 
you will no longer have access to the default initializer (or the memberwise initializer, if it’s a structure) for that type. 
This constraint prevents a situation in which additional essential setup provided in a more complex initializer is accidentally circumvented by 
someone using one of the automatic initializers.

13. Explain about the class's intialization.
All of a class's stored properties - including any properties the class inherits from its superclass - must be assigned as initial value during initialization. 

14. How swift makes sure all stored properties of class initialized?
Swift defines two kinds of initializers for class types to help all stored properties receive an initial value. 
These are known as designated initializers and convenience initializers. 

15. What is designated initializers?
Designated initializers are the primary initializers for a class. 
A designated initializer fully initializes all properties introduced by that class and calls an appropriate superclass initializer to continue the initialization process continues up 
the superclass chain. 

init(<#parameters#>) {
<#statements#>
}

16. What is conveniece initializers?
Convenience initializers are secondary initializers for a class. You can define a convenience initializers to call a designated initilizer from the same class as the convenience initializers 
with some of the designated initializers parameters set to defalut values. 
You can also define a convenience initializer to create an instance of that class for a specific use case or input value type.
Providing the convenience initializer is optional/need basis. 

convenience init(<#parameters#>) {
<#statements#>
}

17. Explain rules in initializer delegation for class types.
To simplify the relationships between designated and convenience initializers, swift applies 3 rules for delegation class between initializers, 
Rule 1: 
A designated initializer must call a designated initializer from its immediate superclass.

Rule 2: 
A convenience initializer must call another initializer from the same class.

Rule 3:
A convenience initializer must ultimately call a designated initializer.

A simple way to remember this is:
Designated initializers must always delegate up.
Convenience initializers must always delegate across.

18. What is two-phase initialization?
Class initialization in Swift is a two-phase process. 
In the first phase, each stored property is assigned an initial value by the class that introduced it. Once the initial state for every stored property has been determined,
the second phase begins, and each class is given the opportunity to customize its stored properties further before the new instance is considered ready for use. 

19. Why two-phase initialization?
The use of two-phase initialization process makes initialization safe, while still giving complete flexibility to each class in a class hierarchy. 
Two-phase initialization prevents property values from being accessed before they’re initialized,
and prevents property values from being set to a different value by another initializer unexpectedly.

20. By default swift initializers are inherited in class?
No. Swift subclasses don't inherit their superclass initializers by default. 
Swift’s approach prevents a situation in which a simple initializer from a superclass is inherited by a more specialized subclass and is used to create a new instance of the subclass 
that isn’t fully or correctly initialized.

21. What will be the solution if subclass present same initializers as its superclass?
Provide the custom implementation of those initializers within the subclass. 
When you write a subclass initializer that matches a superclass designated initializer, you are effectively providing an override of that designated initializer. 
Therefore, you must write the override modifier before the subclass’s initializer definition. 
Note that, 
Conversely, if you write a subclass initializer that matches a superclass convenience initializer, 
that superclass convenience initializer can never be called directly by your subclass, 
as per the rules described above in Initializer Delegation for Class Types. Therefore, 
your subclass is not (strictly speaking) providing an override of the superclass initializer. 
As a result, you don’t write the override modifier when providing a matching implementation of a superclass convenience initializer.

22. In which case subclass can automatically inherit super class initializers?
Subclasses don’t inherit their superclass initializers by default. However, superclass initializers are automatically inherited if certain conditions are met.
Assuming that you provide default values for any new properties you introduce in a subclass, the following two rules apply:
Rule 1:
If your subclass doesn’t define any designated initializers, it automatically inherits all of its superclass designated initializers.

Rule 2: 
If your subclass provides an implementation of all of its superclass designated initializers — either by inheriting them as per rule 1, 
or by providing a custom implementation as part of its definition — then it automatically inherits all of the superclass convenience initializers.

23. What is Failable initializers?
There are cases where initialization may fail due to invalid initialization parameter values, the absence of a required external resource, or some other condition that prevents initialization
from succeeding.

To cope with initialization conditions that can fail, define one or more failable initializers as part of a class, structure, or enumeration definition. 
You write a failable initializer by placing a question mark after the init keyword (init?).

Note:
You can’t define a failable and a nonfailable initializer with the same parameter types and names.

A failable initializer creates an optional value of the type it initializes. 
You write return nil within a failable initializer to indicate a point at which initialization failure can be triggered.

24. Enumeration with raw value - explain the failable initializer 
Enumerations with raw values automatically receive a failable initializer, init?(rawValue:), 
that takes a parameter called rawValue of the appropriate raw-value type and selects a matching enumeration case if one is found, 
or triggers an initialization failure if no matching value exists.
