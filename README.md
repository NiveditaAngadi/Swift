Details  about swift programming language

Swift is safe and fast programming language that combines the best in modern language thinking with wisdom from a diverse open source community. 

Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:
- Variables are always initialized before use.
- Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.
- Integers are checked for overflow.
- Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.
- Memory is managed automatically.
- Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.
