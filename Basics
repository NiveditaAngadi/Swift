Let - do define a constant, it means you can use the constant multiple places but assign a value once only
Var - do define a variable. 

let, var - types can be inferred by compiler based on the value assigned. 

Values are never implicitly converted to another type. 
If you need to convert a value to a different type, explicitly make an instance of the desired type.

Control flow 
if, switch -> make conditions
